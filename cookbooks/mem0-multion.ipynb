Conventional methods using water-level sensors need high-maintenance to hardly achieve full coverage. Recent advances employ surveillance camera imagery and deep learning for detection, yet these struggle amidst scarce data and adverse environments.\\n   - Date: 10 July, 2024\\n\\n2. **Intercepting Unauthorized Aerial Robots in Controlled Airspace Using Reinforcement Learning**\\n   - Authors: Francisco Giral, Ignacio Gómez, Soledad Le Clainche\\n   - Abstract: Ensuring the safe and efficient operation of airspace, particularly in urban environments and near critical infrastructure, necessitates effective methods to intercept unauthorized or non-cooperative UAVs. This work addresses the critical need for robust, adaptive systems capable of managing such scenarios.\\n   - Date: 9 July, 2024\\n\\n3. **Efficient Materials Informatics between Rockets and Electrons**\\n   - Authors: Adam M. Krajewski\\n   - Abstract: This paper discusses the distinct efforts existing at three general scales of abstractions of what a material is - atomistic, physical, and design. At each, an efficient materials informatics is being built from the ground up based on the fundamental understanding of the underlying prior knowledge, including the data.\\n   - Date: 5 July, 2024\\n\\n4. **ObfuscaTune: Obfuscated Offsite Fine-tuning and Inference of Proprietary LLMs on Private Datasets**\\n   - Authors: Ahmed Frikha, Nassim Walha, Ricardo Mendes, Krishna Kanth Nakka, Xue Jiang, Xuebing Zhou\\n   - Abstract: This paper proposes ObfuscaTune, a novel, efficient, and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective method to ensure the confidentiality of both the model and the data during offsite fine-tuning on a third-party cloud provider.\\n   - Date: 3 July, 2024\\n\\n5. **MG-Verilog: Multi-grained Dataset Towards Enhanced LLM-assisted Verilog Generation**\\n   - Authors: Yongan Zhang, Zhongzhi Yu, Yonggan Fu, Cheng Wan, Yingyan Celine Lin\\n   - Abstract: This paper discusses the necessity of providing domain-specific data during inference, fine-tuning, or pre-training to effectively leverage LLMs in hardware design. Existing publicly available hardware datasets are often limited in size, complexity, or detail, which hinders the effectiveness of LLMs in this domain.\\n   - Date: 1 July, 2024\\n\\n6. **The Future of Aerial Communications: A Survey of IRS-Enhanced UAV Communication Technologies**\\n   - Authors: Zina Chkirbene, Ala Gouissem, Ridha Hamila, Devrim Unal\\n   - Abstract: The advent of Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is setting a new benchmark in the field of wireless communications. IRS, with their groundbreaking ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves, have opened avenues for substantial enhancements in signal quality, network efficiency, and spectral usage.\\n   - Date: 2 June, 2024\\n\\n7. **Scalable and RISC-V Programmable Near-Memory Computing Architectures for Edge Nodes**\\n   - Authors: Michele Caon, Clément Choné, Pasquale Davide Schiavone, Alexandre Levisse, Guido Masera, Maurizio Martina, David Atienza\\n   - Abstract: The widespread adoption of data-centric algorithms, particularly AI and ML, has exposed the limitations of centralized processing, driving the need for scalable and programmable near-memory computing architectures for edge nodes.\\n   - Date: 20 June, 2024\\n\\n8. **Enhancing robustness of data-driven SHM models: adversarial training with circle loss**\\n   - Authors: Xiangli Yang, Xijie Deng, Hanwei Zhang, Yang Zou, Jianxi Yang\\n   - Abstract: Structural health monitoring (SHM) is critical to safeguarding the safety and reliability of aerospace, civil, and mechanical infrastructures. This paper discusses the use of adversarial training with circle loss to enhance the robustness of data-driven SHM models.\\n   - Date: 20 June, 2024\\n\\n9. **Understanding Pedestrian Movement Using Urban Sensing Technologies: The Promise of Audio-based Sensors**\\n   - Authors: Chaeyeon Han, Pavan Seshadri, Yiwei Ding, Noah Posner, Bon Woo Koo, Animesh Agrawal, Alexander Lerch, Subhrajit Guhathakurta\\n   - Abstract: Understanding pedestrian volumes and flows is essential for designing safer and more attractive pedestrian infrastructures. This study discusses a new approach to scale up urban sensing of people with the help of novel audio-based technology.\\n   - Date: 14 June, 2024\\n\\nASK_USER_HELP: Deshraj, I have found several papers that might be of interest to you.

## Qdrant

[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) is an open-source vector search engine. It is designed to work with large-scale datasets and provides a high-performance search engine for vector data.

To use Qdrant you can do like this:

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory


config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "qdrant",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "test",
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 6333,
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
m.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "hobbies"})
```

## Chroma

[Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) is an AI-native open-source vector database that simplifies building LLM apps by providing tools for storing, embedding, and searching embeddings with a focus on simplicity and speed.

To use ChromaDB you can do like this:

```python
import os
from mem0 import Memory


config = {
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "chroma",
        "config": {
            "collection_name": "test",
            "path": "db",
        }
    }
}

m = Memory.from_config(config)
m.add("Likes to play cricket on weekends", user_id="alice", metadata={"category": "hobbies"})
```

## Common issues

### Using model with different dimensions

If you are using customized model, which is having different dimensions other than 1536
for example 768, you may encounter below error:

`ValueError: shapes (0,1536) and (768,) not aligned: 1536 (dim 1) != 768 (dim 0)`

you could add `"embedding_model_dims": 768,` to the config of the vector_store to overcome this issue.
